Introduction

Choosing a best outfit is one of the challenges that we face while we go for shopping. Even after spending lots of time on shopping for dresses, 
finally we buy a dress that we will not be fully satisfied in. Some dress that attracts us while its shown in the showcase, may not be good after we wear them on the big day.

So, this project is to create an application that will help us choose the best suited outfit, that would be perfect for us, according to our body type, and skin color.

To find out your Body shape :

The first thing you need to do is take a front full picture of yourself using fitted clothes that let your body shape show.

Then you can either print it or draw on it with an editing app the following dots:

1 dot over your left shoulder (Over the joint of the shoulder and the arm)
1 dot over your right shoulder (over the joint of the shoulder and the arm)
1 dot in the left end of your waist.
1 dot in the right end of your waist.
1 dot in the left end of your base hip (The most prominent part of your hip)
1 dot in the left end of your base hip (The most prominent part of your hip)

Defining Our System!

So, our system will help you to find out your body type and give you the best advice to choose the best outfit according to our body type and skin type.
This application is basically like a personal fashion advisor. With this application, we can find the best type of dress and the colors that will look stunning when we wear them. 
And, it will save a lot of time in shopping, as we will have only few options to choose from, instead of having ureselfs choose from a huge variety of amazing outfits.
