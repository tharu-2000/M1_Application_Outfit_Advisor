# FLOWCHART

A flowchart is a picture of the separate steps of a process in sequential order. It is a generic tool that can be adapted for a wide variety of purposes, and can be used to describe various processes, such as a manufacturing process, an administrative or service process, or a project plan.

Elements that may be included in a flowchart are a sequence of actions, materials or services entering or leaving the process (inputs and outputs), decisions that must be made, people who become involved, time involved at each step, and/or process measurements.

# When to use a flowchart :

* To develop understanding of how a process is done

* To study a process for improvement

* To communicate to others how a process is done

* When better communication is needed between people involved with the same process

* To document a process

* When planning a project

# UML - Unified Modelling Language

A standardized modeling language consisting of an integrated set of diagrams, developed to help system and software developers for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, as well as for business modeling and other non-software systems. The UML represents a collection of best engineering practices that have proven successful in the modeling of large and complex systems. The UML is a very important part of developing object oriented software and the software development process. The UML uses mostly graphical notations to express the design of software projects. Using the UML helps project teams communicate, explore potential designs, and validate the architectural design of the software.

# Behavioral Diagrams

UML’s five behavioral diagrams are used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the dynamic aspects of a system. It shows how the system behaves and interacts with itself and other entities (users, other systems). They show how data moves through the system, how objects communicate with each other, how the passage of time affects the system, or what events cause the system to change internal states. Since behavior diagrams illustrate the behavior of a system, they are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems. As an example, the activity diagram describes the business and operational step-by-step activities of the components in a system.

# Behavioral Diagram

# Activity Diagram

It is a graphical representations of workflows of stepwise activities and actions with support for choice, iteration and concurrency

# Use Case Diagram

It describes a system’s functional requirements in terms of use cases that enable you to relate what you need from a system to how the system delivers on those needs.

# State Machine Diagram

It shows the discrete behavior of a part of a designed system through finite state transitions.

# Sequence Diagram

It shows the sequence of messages exchanged between the objects needed to carry out the functionality of the scenario.

# Communication Diagram

It shows interactions between objects and/or parts (represented as lifelines) using sequenced messages in a free-form arrangement.

# Interaction Overview Diagram

It depicts a control flow with nodes that can contain other interaction diagrams.

# Timing Diagram

It shows interactions when the primary purpose of the diagram is to reason about time by focusing on conditions changing within and among lifelines along a linear time axis.

# Structural Diagrams

Structure diagrams depict the static structure of the elements in your system. i.e., how one object relates to another. It shows the things in the system – classes, objects, packages or modules, physical nodes, components, and interfaces. For example, just as the static aspects of a house encompass the existence and placement of such things as walls, doors, windows, pipes, wires, and vents. The Seven UML structural diagrams are roughly organized around the major groups of things you’ll find when modeling a system.

Since structure diagrams represent the structure, they are used extensively in documenting the software architecture of software systems.

# Composite Structure Diagram

It shows the internal structure of a classifier, classifier interactions with the environment through ports, or behavior of a collaboration.

# Deployment Diagram

It shows a set of nodes and their relationships that illustrates the static deployment view of an architecture.

# Package Diagram

It groups related UML elements into a collection of logically related UML structure.

# Profile Diagram
# Class Diagram

It shows a set of classes, interfaces, and collaborations and their relationships, typically, found in modeling object-oriented systems.

# Object Diagram

It shows a set of objects and their relationships, which is the static snapshots of instances of the things found in class diagrams.

# Component Diagram

It shows a set of components and their relationships that illustrates the static implementation view of a system.
