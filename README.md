# Introduction

Choosing a best outfit is one of the challenges that we face while we go for shopping. Even after spending lots of time on shopping for dresses, finally we buy a dress that we will not be fully satisfied in. Some dress that attracts us while its shown in the showcase, may not be good after we wear them on the big day.

So, this project is to calculate the body shape of female, according to their bust size, waist size, high hip size and hip size values. Then, according to to body shape, with respect to the choice of dress, jumsuits, shorts, skrits, jeans, the different types of the outfit chosen will be displayed which is best suitable for that particular body type, will be displayed .

Female body shapes in the fashion industry
In the fashion industry, body shapes are often categorized into four classes.

* Apple, or inverted triangle

    This body shape describes a person who has broader shoulders and bust than they do hips.

* Banana, straight, or rectangle

    This body shape describes a person who typically has waist measurements that are less than 9 inches smaller than the hip or bust measurements.

* Pear, spoon, bell, or triangle
